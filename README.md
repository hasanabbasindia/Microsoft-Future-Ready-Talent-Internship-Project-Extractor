### Azure AI Services | Computer Vision
- In this project, this service is employed to perform character extraction on images(PNG, JPEG). It can effortlessly extract text from the mentioned and even PDF files. With its robust capabilities, it's an essential component for extracting text from scanned documents or images and making it available for further processing within your application.
- It takes in any type of document or images written in English and is sent to the service to extract data from it
- Inside Computer Vision Studio under the Optical Character Recognition , the feature Extract Text from Image is used to do the work of getting any complicated written text from the different formates.

### Azure AI Services | Translator
- This Azure Service plays a crucial role in making the application multilingual and accessible to a global audience. This service is used to translate the extracted English text into multiple languages. It enables the application to break language barriers, providing seamless communication and understanding for users regardless of their language preferences. This feature is especially valuable in applications where content needs to be translated or localized, broadening the reach and impact of your project.

- In this the extracted text is sent and then each line-by-line is translated from English to any preferred language provided in the application.

- Below given image is an example of the translated English text into "Spanish" and like-wise the user can translated into any desired language from English to any language. This is the translated language from the previous previous example in a JSON format.

### Azure App Service
- Azure App Service serves as the hosting platform for the application's user interface. With this service, I can deploy my application in a convenient and scalable manner. It allows me to focus on the development of my application without the need to manage the underlying infrastructure. This simplifies the deployment process and ensures that the application is easily accessible to users via the Azure portal. Azure App Service provides a robust and reliable environment for your Streamlit-based application, making it available to a broad audience.

- The entire code related from extraction, translations to Streamlit(web-application) is pushed to the Github.
- After the code is pushed successfully, the github project URL is then given to the Azure App service and then the deployment starts automatically.
- Below is the deployment status of the website.
